    <h1> Descriptive Statistics </h1>
    <p> Descriptive statistics describe and summarize the characteristics of a dataset or sample data.
        By using descriptive statistics, we can summarize large amounts of observed data in a meaningful way. 
        While descriptive statistics are powerful, they have limitations‚Äîfor example, summarizing data means losing some granularity.

    <h3> Measure of central tendency </h3>
    <p>
        A measure of central tendency represents the center point or typical value of a dataset. 
        It's like finding the heart of the data or the value around which most other values cluster.
        There are <b> three common measures </b> of central tendency:

    <h4> The Mean </h4>

        The mean is the most common way to summarize the center of a distribution.
